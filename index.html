        The Origin & Role of Patina in Denmark
    </p>

    <SPAN STYLE="color:#FFFFFF">
    <p>
        Ever since I’ve left my country behind, I’ve found myself being naturally attracted to something i have always been visually attracted to, which is something quite important of our cultural heritage. In a general sense it is a layer that forms on a surface. The focus here will more precisely be on the patina we know from the statue of liberty being the result of copper oxidation. In this ~~work~~, we will dig into the origins of patina, we will take a closer look into its role within denmark. Then we will look further into its ~~double function~~; aesthetically and ~~preservatory~~.

origins of patina - chemical process of patina and its historical recognition

A little history of patina brings us close to the material of copper. Copper was the first metal that was used by humans around 8000 B.C.. by the neolithic people of the late stone age. It was mainly used for tools, ornaments and knives, due to its malleability and availability, replacing stone which was more complicated to work with. Copper is believed to have been found in regions that we today call Turkey, Iran and Iraq. The patina would naturally appear over time and be used for its protectiveness of corrosion. 

Later patina was very present on statues, copper tools and architectural elements in Greece and Rome. It was considered prestigious and claimed that something has value.

A little time overview: (maybe keep visible timeline)

(antiquity) 100 

During Antiquity, in ancient rome, their buildings would have copper roofs which would gradually oxidate. (pantheon?)

(middle ages) 500-1500

In medieval times, european church spires and roofs we’re made of copper, because of its weather resistant capabilities. patina gained a cultural significance becoming a symbol age & permanence.

(renaissance/early modern period) 1400-1800 

sculptures like the donatello included patina as choice. artist would progressively use the patina for its benefits. 

-copper ships (1700) used for its corrosion protection

(industrial revolution) 1800-1900

-major use of copper in buildings (ex Statue of liberty) well known aesthetically (acidic rain)

(modern era) 20-21st century

scientific studies were made intensively to understand patina results in order to control it for its double benefits.

restoration projects as for the statue of liberty were focusing on maintaining (preserving) the patina effect.

In the the 70s, Andy Warhol experimented with oxidation, by using bodily fluids that he would call the *Oxidation, Piss and Cum* paintings. Nowadays we have Daniel Arsham working primarily with the patina effect on 

present day:

preservations nowadays balances between the aesthetics and protection from desctructive corrosion

Ref book patina recipe:

“the surface of the metal will also be altered by the effects of the atmoshpere, causing gradual changes which initailly tarnish the metal with thin unven colouringm and whihc may eventually cause the whole surface to bedome converted into a basic mineral product which is typically green in color”

“On a number of occasions in the history of metalwork, there has been a revival of interest in the metalwork and sculpture carried on at earlier periods, and  the ancient artefacts of an earlier period, complete with the natiral patination generally produced by long burial, have been assiduously collected and studied. the revivals of interest in classicism, notably in renaissance italy and the chin dynasty in 12th century china, carried with them a desire to imitate the natural patination associated with the prized artefacts and eventually led to a concern with artificial patination as a finishing process in its own right for contemporary work.!!”

*functional: protection from corrosion*

*Aesthetic: visual appeal*

*Symbolic: represents history and authenticity*
