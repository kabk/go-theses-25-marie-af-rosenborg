			<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

			    <p>
					This thesis explores the cultural, historical and architectural significance of Boersen, the iconic stock exchange building in Copenhagen, Denmark, and its profound role in the collective memory of the Danish people. Through my personal connection with the building and the emotional impact of the tragic fire in April 2024, I will research the different ways in which the architectural evolution of Boersen reflects the cultural and historical identity of Denmark. The research is also delving into the restoration efforts following the fire, examining the challenges of the preservation of authenticity while integrating modern technology. Using the 2024 fire at Boersen as a case study, this research poses the question, if historical buildings should be reconstructed or not, and to what extent should they be replicated in order to maintain their legacy.
				</p>

			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					I grew up in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, surrounded by its rich architecture dating from historic to contemporary buildings.

					There was always this one specific building I was emotionally attached to, the old stock market, Boersen. I had the chance to visit its interior as a child. This building stood out as a centre piece in the heart of Denmark, with its Dutch architecture style, green roof and dragon spire. My wish is to investigate the relationship we have with historical buildings, diving into the history that lies behind the rise and the fall of this iconic building of my home country.
                    On the 16th of April 2024, I saw a horrible sight on a friends instagram story. The most beautiful building of Denmark had caught fire. A big part of our cultural heritage was lost on that day. More than half of the building and most importantly the spire collapsed. What can we learn from cases like the burning of Boersen, should historical buildings be reconstructed and to what extent?
				</p>

			<h2 id="chapter-1">Inferno</h2>

				<p>
					Suddenly, on the 16th of April 2024, at around 7.36 in the morning alarms were ringing due to a fire within Boersen. For around two years the building was going through a big cleanup to be all pretty for its upcoming 400 year birthday
					and a new copper roof was a part of that process, aswell as replacing the bricks and fixing the sandstones. The	building being under construction somehow led to an outburst of fire by the copper roof, where it was being replaced. The fire would be directed by the wind and made its way to the dragon spire, which tragically collapsed into many pieces. It is still not known what exactly happened or at least it has not been shared. During which seemed like a never-ending fire, around 120 firefighters did their best to put out the flames. This so called accident (which is still not clarified)

					reminded me of the fire of Notre Dame. When Notre Dame went up in flames, I was present in Paris, and I immediately felt the pain and sorrow within the city. Although a disaster, a part of beauty lies in these moments, it gathers people somehow. It’s almost like funerals, we gather to celebrate something that once was,
            		we mourn together, then we go on with our lives until it happens again. <br> <br>
                    Public and political reactions <br> <br>
                    For the fire of Boersen, there was the same reaction as in Paris. As the building was burning, early in the morning, the city was already up, with people biking, driving and walking to work. As the grey smoke and the inferno started to show, crowds would gather around this devastating view. The firefighters would do their best to aim straight at the fire within the building and use the water from the nearby canal; civilians didn’t hesitate to give a hand. The wind was accelerating the flames, slowly but surely wrapping its nasty flames around the building. The building also houses historical paintings and furniture, like “Fra Koebenhavns Boers “, by P.S Kroeyer, showing 50 important Danish businessmen inside the building itself. Many big scale paintings were saved from the building. Horrifying images show various people carrying these big paintings to safe spaces, with the burning building in the background. At 8.31 the spire collapses dramatically. Soldiers of the Royal Guard were called in early to ensure public safety and to help carrying artefacts. “Danes have expressed their horror at ‘400 years of culture going up in flames’ after the huge blaze broke out at the historic stock exchange.”

                    symbolic value for a nation.

					The CEO of Danish Chamber of Commerce, Brian Mikkelsen, was as shocked as the Danish people, : “-We have lost our cultural heritage. It’s a huge disaster. It’s one of the most important buildings in Denmark, and we were in the middle of restoring it, so that it could shine, and we wanted to show what it has meant for the danish business in 400 years.”

					The problem with the fire was also the fact that, in the first place the building was being renovated not only for the copper roofing but also for fixing the problem of the bricks which are built in a way that let no air come through, making the air go through the parts made of sandstone, which are all the more decorative parts. This lead the most original parts to be damaged.

					The interior contains a large amount of wood construction and the roof being made of copper, kept the warmth inside. “Everything inside the building is fragile and made from wood. So, it’s a little like having an oven going on with a fire inside it.This is also one of the reasons why the fire got so violent during the day,”. <br> <br>
                    What exactly was being renovated and what is the plan now? <br> <br>
                    It was announced in 2020 that Boersen, would undergo renovation. Being built in 1620, its anniversary of 400 years led the Danish Chamber of Commerce to 
                    decide to clean up the building, with the idea of staying true to Christian IV’s vision. The initial plan was to restore it with a new copper roof, to add a whole new set of bricks and to renove the many sandstones. They claim that the roof having been oxidating for 140 years had done its time. Back in 1883 the building went under renovation where the bricks were replaced with bricks which were modern at that time, but brought a problem to the building, the bricks being waterproof, didn’t let the building breathe and this made the natural moisture work its way through the sandstone decoration and degrades it much faster. There are no original sandstones left on the façade, but there are plaster copies of most of them. In order to understand the context of the fire and its aftermath I interviewed Anna Gertrude Kampmann, an architect working on saving Boersen. We discussed the challenges and considerations involved in the restoration of the Boersen. 13 February 2025 (10 months after the fire). <br> <br>
                    Could you describe your role in the rebuilding process of the building? <br> <br>
                    I’m working on the project as a part 3 architect.

					So far I have been in charge of saving as much as possible of the original material from the eastern part of 
                    the building. Parallel to this I am working with the vision for the project and the more theoretical part about how to rebuild after the fire. <br>
                    What challenges or unique considerations come with working on a historic building like the old stock market? <br> <br>
                    There are many challenges, but the most important and difficult ones will be how to rebuild the building for future generations without it feeling “fake”. The
                    technical challenges are the other great question. With todays climate crisis and requirements for technical spec, it’s a great challenge to design the building 
                    so it doesn’t show.<br> <br> 
                    How does copper as a material contribute to both the aesthetics and the longevity of the structure? <br> <br>
                    Copper gets more beautiful with age. With good solid materials age becomes an advantage. The building only becomes more beautiful with age. <br>
                    For the rebuilt structure, are there efforts to recreate the previous patina, or will the roof be left to develop its own naturally over time? <br>
                    The heritage authorities in Denmark doesn’t support replicating patina. So, the roof will be let to develop its own. Maybe that’s also more interesting in the 
                    end – as it is more truthful to the era the roof is built in. <br> <br> 
                    Are there any modern methods or technologies being used in the rebuilding that differ from the original construction? <br> <br>
                    Yes. But we have only just started making these choices. At the moment we are looking at how the trees for the new roof structure will be cut. Where there are 
                    advantages, such as architectural features, we strive to use the original methods.<br> <br> 
                    How do you balance maintaining the authenticity of the original design while incorporating contemporary techniques or materials? <br> <br>
                    Very good question, I think it’s about being honest and transparent when you introduce something new, but making sure the materials and forms coexist in beauty 
                    and uplift each other. The basis for these choices lies in the strategy for the restoration which we are working on, at the moment. This is a report in which you,
                    in words and images, describe how to approach different challenges – and should work as a tool throughout the process making sure the end result is a well curated
                    new whole. <br> <br>
                    Has the fire influenced the way you approach rebuilding or preserving the building? <br> <br>
                    Yes, absolutely. When so much original material is gone, it opens up a huge pile of questions. It’s simply not possible to recreate most of the things as we don’t 
                    have the information required. So what do you do then? <br> <br> 
                    Do you think the new roof will resonate with the public in the same way the old one did? <br> <br>
                    Probably not! We all love the green roofs of Copenhagen. But also, we are used to them being renewed. Just have a look at Christiansborg, Frederiksborg etc. It’s 
                    better for the building, so I guess people prefer that the building doesn’t suffer. <br> <br> 
                    How do you see the rebuilding of the roof contributing to the continued legacy of the stock market? <br> <br> 
                    It’s a question of preservation. Making sure the next generations have a building that doesn’t crumble. Originally the roof was lead. The copper roof is from the 
                    later 1800. So even though the population of Copenhagen probably see it at original and has feelings attached to it, reality is that it’s not very old and not original. <br>
                    Could you describe any challenges you’ve faced in those tasks, particularly when working with copper? <br> <br> 
                    The craftmanship. The biggest challenge has been that the number of craftsmen able to work with copper at this level is very few. So, to be able to build and meet 
                    a deadline and it not being too expensive is challenging! <br> <br> 
                    Are there any historical techniques you’ve studied or adopted during this project? <br> <br> 
                    All of the used techniques are rooted in historical techniques. In the making of masonry, woodwork, copper roofing, mortar and bricks! And more to be added to the 
                    list in the near future! <br> <br> 
                    How does your work honor the building’s original craftsmanship? <br> <br> 
                    The fact is that actually a lot of the original material of the building didn’t exist anymore..And a lot had been changed over the time. So the building wasn’t in 
                    a very “original” condition before the fire. We are very much looking at the parts that are left from the 1600 which are still in place. <br> <br> 
                    How long do you estimate it will take for the new copper roof to develop the rich patina we had before the fire? <br> <br> 
                    It probably won’t. That green color is almost impossible to get again because we don’t have acid rain in the atmosphere (which is a good thing for our health though..). <br>
                    What is the process of removing the patinated roof? Do you clean the patina off the copper, or put new copper plates? What do you do with the old copper plates? <br>
                    Actually, the copper is melted and then re-used on the roof! <br> <br> 
                    Do you see the new roof as a chance to reintroduce the building to a new generation, or does it mainly serve to restore what was lost? <br> <br> 
                    It’s an inevitable part of taking care of the building and making sure it survives and serves future generations. As previously described, understanding what actually original material is and what isn’t and the technical issues with the building are essential in terms of understanding how its best preserved for the future. A good example is the brick cladding on the façade, which is late 1800, and not renaissance.<br>
                    ---------
                    Here we come to the realisation, that it’s challenging to respect the rules of a listed building while also being aware of the difficulties the building faces, for example the moisture problem.
                    The state not allowing to replicate the patina is reassuring, this made Boersen stand out and made it truly authentic. Since it’s copper and the green color was the result of oxidation of 140 years was not something controlled by the builders, but more depending on the acidic rain that we don’t have anymore. It’s a work in progress, it shows that aging here adds value and beauty. Good things come with time. The current generation had the opportunity to experience everything Boersen could provide, a true reminder of the passage of time. Now the professional team behind the reconstruction have the responsibility of leaving behind traces of Christian IV, but also adding our trace, including the fire of 2024. The current king, Frederik X left a trace behind by placing a symbolic foundation stone, covering a time capsule consisting of a description of Denmark in 2024.

                <p> 
					In order to understand why the fire was as devastating for the Danish population I will dig deeper into the role and impact of the building.
					The contruction of the old stock exchange, Boersen started back in 1619 and was finalized in 1623. Marble was brought from Tuscany, sandstone and
					timber from Sweden and the bricks from Holland. Christian IV who reigned from 1588 to 1648 had the intention of building it to increase trade and
					commerce in Denmark. From his castle located next to it, the king was following closely brick by brick.
					In the beginning of the 17th century the great ambitions for foreign policy led Christian IV to expand Denmarks influence and access to valuable raw
					materials like gold and spices from India. In 1616, Christian IV launched the Danish East Indian Company and sent out an expedition. In 1620 the 
					expedition did secure a treaty, which would give Denmark control of the village Tranquebar on the Indian South East coast. This would mark the
					beginning of the Danish colonial presence in India.
					The king would finance many of his architectural projects, they would be financed by his success with the establishment of the Danish East Indian 
					Company aswell as the colony in Tranquebar and his royal revenues.

					Inside the walls <br> <br>
					Initially, the ground floor and first floor were used as a market place with trade stalls. In 1855 the building was bought by the Grosserer Society.
					This would lead to Boersen being the first listed building in Denmark, it might be the first commodity exhange in Europe. The architect Harald Conrad
					Stilling did some work on the interior of the building. In 1918 there was an attack by anarchistic homeless people on the old stock market (The 
					storm of Boersen). Today in the year of 2025 the building is owned by the Danish Chamber of Commerce, one of Denmark’s largest business and employer
					organizations. They use the building as their headquarters. The aesthetics of Boersen
					The dragon spire from 1625 is composed of 4 dragons with their tails intertwined into the shape of a spire, at the top three crowns are placed on top 
					of eachother representing the three kingdoms Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The spire was drawn by firework master, Ludvig Heldtruder and originally made
					of lead which was to heavy so its was later changed to wood in 1778. It is often used as a protective animal, which keeps away all evil and danger. 
					Maybe it was inspired by symbols in the viking period or since being a master of fireworks it could be from the fireworks homeland, China, where 
					dragons are used to keep safe.

					Having literally stood there for 400 years, the building has had quite a sight. The dragons have always protected
					the building from wars and fires happening around it, until 2024 they we’re not able to defend the building unfortunately.
					The buildings architecture is built in a Dutch renaissance style. It was originally built with lead roof, but during the Swedish occupation (1658-59),
					the lead was used to make cannon balls. It was only by the end of the 19th century that the roof was covered with the well known copper.
					It was renovated back in the late 19th century, the bricks were removed and replaced to more machine made bricks which seemed fitting at the time. 
					Throughout these last years it became a big problem regarding moisture, it couldn’t get through the waterproof masonry. It would instead go through
					the sandstone decorations and later destroy them.

					Boersens has sandstones surrounding the building, they have historical and aesthetical value. They serve as the building’s structural foundation with
					its intricate sculptures. The figures included caryatids, herms and heads, they’re central to the building’s Renaissance character. Each unique 
					pieces shows a different expressions and craftsmanship.
					The roof being made from copper has a quite interesting process. Copper as we know it has a shiny brownish-orange color, but first and foremost it is
					chemical element of a metal.

					As soon as copper is exposed to air, the patina process starts. 
					Boersens copper roofing was built around 140 years ago and was known for its green aesthetic. Copper roofing is often chosen for historical buildings
					which have to stay for decades. This can be explained due to the natural process of patina. Patina is a layer forming on top copper in this case. 
					The layer is acquired through exposure and time, so it is something that clearly shows that a building has value and wants to be preserved. Patina 
				    is also literally a coating of preservation which makes it quite symbolic to have a the roof. Patina is similar to nostalgia, a layered proof of 
					the passing of time. Both preserve history while revealing its passage.

					Restorative Nostalgia <br> <br>
                    
                    Directly related to what is intended with Boersen we can refer to Svetlana Boym’s term of restorative nostalgia, which is an effort to revive the past.

					Svetlanas reflective nostalgia embraces change, like the natural evolution of patina, while restorative nostalgia seeks to bring things back to their original state which reflects the debate of Boersens reconstruction. Patina protects copper, like memory protects cultural identity, which makes it a visual metaphor for nostalgia. By reconstructing exactly how it was in 1620, the Danish Chamber of Commerce seeks to reconstruct exactly how Christian IV intended it be. But this is also not possible in a way, it’ll never be the same. After 400 years a lot has evolved, specialist in all fields have progressed. Also our environment as changed. One problem that is mentioned in the interview is that they’re facing a lack of craftmanship in the field of the copper roofing, nowadays the skills have decreased compared to the required level needed.	“We must be part of historical continuity to give meaning to new forms”,

					which can be taken in several ways, history must be studied in order to	not repeat our mistakes, we need to see where we come from to understand our present. The wood initially came from Gotland more than 500 years ago, it will once again be found there if possible, otherwise it might be from Germany or Denmark. The bricks will be reused, cleaned and put through safety tests. The copper will be melted and reused. A clear attempt of restoring a national symbol, since it’s the first building in Denmark having been listed . Again the techniques use for the copper are old techniques which we 
					don’t have a lot of experience with nowadays. Boersen was the first listed building in Denmark, today theres around 9000 listed buildings. This 
					reflects a need to reclaim historical identity. <br> <br>
					Reflective Nostalgia / Inevitable Change <br> <br>
					Rebuilding a lost past as if time had not altered it is not so realistic. Following the exact recipe of Christian’s architectural plan isn’t realisitc either, a lot has changed in 400 years. The passage of time cannot be undone and this is where we can talk about Boym’s reflective nostalgia, which is being aware of the idealizing momentum of the desired past.

					The copper roof which had covered the building for 140 years was as green as it gets, meaning really oxidated. Nowadays we lack of acidic rain,
					which is a good thing for us humans, but not for copper. So concerning the roof we will never be able to restore the natural patina we had, but 
					Christian IV wasn’t even aware of the copper roof at all. Thus the form is being restored but with a different aesthetic of its aging. This shows 
					how history can be preserved but never truly recreated. The fire safety adjustments will introduce some modern elements proving that reinterpretations are important regsrding historical reconstructions.
					Mix between restorative and reflective nostalgia, a respectable effort lies in attempting to reconstructing it and reveals its impossibility of 
					fully restoring it. It reflects how we remember, preserve and reinterpret. In relation to Paul B. Preciados answer to the Notre-Dame fire,

					the argument against the reconstion of historical building is clear. The restoration often oversees the transformations worth. Preciado underlines that
					monuments should’nt be static symbols of the past, but on the contrary they should be active, evolving spaces that engage in the current stories. 
					This resonates with the idea that the buildings history not only reflects it’s original design but also also the marks of the time, like patina on
					copper. The reconstruction risks to erase these layers of historical material which holds history of endurance, decay and change.
					Instead of a perfect reconstruction, keeping the building in the state it is–for example keeping the patina– honoring its authenticity and connection
					to the present time. In this way, the preservation of historic structures should focus on their lived history rather than an idealized vision of the
					past, so that they can remain alive and meaningful in their ongoing transformation.
